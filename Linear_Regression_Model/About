# Housing Prices Linear Regression Model

This file (`linear_regression_model.ipynb`) contains a **linear regression model** for predicting house prices using the Kaggle House Prices dataset. 

**Key features:**
- Data preprocessing: missing value handling, categorical encoding, scaling
- Model training: Linear Regression
- Evaluation: RÂ² = 0.89, RMSE = 0.11, RMSLE = 0.16
- Predictions vs actual visualization included

This file can be run independently and demonstrates a clean workflow from raw data to model evaluation.
This project currently implements a baseline linear regression model for housing price prediction.
In the next phase, I plan to explore more advanced models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM to further improve prediction accuracy. 
This demonstrates a continuous learning approach and a growth mindset in machine learning.
